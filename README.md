2. HR reporting page (IBM watson data and can choose the filter)

3. We need to connect to IBM watson for Personality Insights https://personality-insights-demo.ng.bluemix.net/ + Natural Language Understanding https://natural-language-understanding-demo.ng.bluemix.net/

4. We want to use firebase to store the data from users

5. Show which potential employees were chosen from the HR (initial list + choose the top ones)

6. https://costargc.github.io/ something following this initial structure for the user side. (we still need to find out how the HR page will look like).

7. Potential employee should upload the information and should be able to view the result on page.
